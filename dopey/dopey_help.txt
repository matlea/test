load(filename)                Loads data and metadata from xy files. Intentifies the data type based
                              on the metadata and sorts it accordingly. Resturns a dict.
dataInfo(dict)                Prints the main info about the content of a dict from (e.g.) load().
dictContents(dict)            As dataInfo() but more detailed.

plot(dict)                    Plots dict data.
fermiMapInteractive(dict)     Interactive plot of a fermi map. Is normally called by plot() unless
                              told otherwise.

quickSpin(dict)               Quick analysis of loaded spin data.
despikeSpin(dict)             Remove spikes in the data.
insertSpinData(dict1, dict2)  Merge two spin edc measurements (if the axes are the same.)
deleteSpinEDCCurve(dict)      Delete one curve from a spin edc measurement.
getSpinEDCfromMDC(dict)       Extract one EDC from a MDC.
normalizeSpin(dict)           Normalize spin data to the background.
polarization(dicts)           Calculate Px,Py,Pz from a list of dicts from quickSpin().
rotatePolarization(dict)      Correct non-normal emission data.

subArray(dict)                Returns a subsection of a data set.
compact(dict)                 Reduce the data dimensionality.

shiftAxis(dict)               Shift axis x, y, or z in a data dict.

align()                       Interactive method that takes a fermi map as input.

dichroism()                   Use with arpes or Fermi map data.
plotDichroism()               Use with arpes or Fermi map data.

etc., etc., etc.
