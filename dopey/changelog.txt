The 2nd version of dopey with a new loader and small modifications of
the methods. Started 2024.05.14.

Last update: 2024.11.27

============================================
dopey_loader.py
============================================

2024.08.30  Added spin arpes as a loadable data type.
            Importing DEFLECTOR_X and DEFLECTOR_Y from dopey_constants.py.
            Make sure to, with time, remove references to DEFLECTORX and DEFLECTORY.
2024.06.08  Minor change to dataInfo().
2024.05.29b The folder was renamed to dopey so I had to update the import from dopey_constants.py.
2024.05.29  load() now runs dataInfo() at the end, unless shup == True.
2024.05.27b Bugfix: getting the correct y-label for arpes and xps.
            Bugfix: fixing saved y and z axes for spin map.
            Added method dataInfo() with alias info() to show (indentified) info of a dict.
2024.05.27  Bugfix: had forgotten to add 'labels' to the dict when loading fermi maps.
2024.05.17  Renamed dict tag measurement_type to type.
2024.05.16  The loader is now ready for arpes, xps, spind edc, spin mcp, spin map, and target scattering.
            If not recognized the loaded semi-sorted data is kept under the key raw_data.
            Copied dictContents() as-as is from the previous dopey_loader.py.
2024.05.14  Started.

============================================
dopey_plot.py
============================================

2024.11.22  Added waterfallPlot().
2024.11.21  Added type 'dicroism' for plotting.
2024.10.05  Disabled type-checking in .plot() since I got it wrong. Return to this later.
2024.10.04  Bugfixes in _plotResultsSpinEDC() and a few other _plotResults...
2024.10.02  Bug in plot() that prevented ax from be passed. Fixed.
2024.08.30b Added a print out for valid arguments for plot().
2024.08.30  Added spin_arpes to the plottable data types. It is the same as for normal arpes.
2024.06.08  Removed a debug print in _plotARPES().
2024.05.29b The folder was renamed to dopey so I had to update the import from dopey_methods.py.
2024.05.29  Fixed bugs in compact() in dopey_methods.py that prevented _plotFermiMapCut() to work propperly
            and updated it accordingly.
2024.05.27  fermiMapInteractive() works, except for the intensity slider. The cut = True does not work yet.
2024.05.26  _plotResultsSpinMDC_FAT() is ready. This method is also used for result spin_map data.
            _plotResultsSpinEDCpolarization() is ready.
2024.05.24  _plotSpinMDC() is ready.
            _plotResultsSpinEDC() and _plotResultsSpinMDC_FE() is ready.
2024.05.17  Updated references to the dict tag measurement_type to reference to its new name (type).
            Copied and modified _plot1d(), _plot2d(), _plotTarget(), and _plotSpinMap() from dopey_viewer.py.
            Still need to do some work on fermi maps.
2024.05.16	Started to migrate and modify the methods in the previous dopey_viewer.py. Starting with plot().
            Now works for xps, arpes, and spin_mdc.

============================================
dopey_methods.py
============================================

2024.10.30  Bug in align() that swapped the x and y axes. Fixed.
2024.10.29  Added align(). Can be improved.
2024.10.25  Bugfix. 
2024.09.18  Added shiftAxis().
2024.05.29b The folder was renamed to dopey so I had to update the import from dopey_constants.py.
            Starting to add methods for fitting Fermi levels: fermi() ok, still working on fermiFit()...
2024.05.29  Fixed bugs in compact() (again chaged keys Type to type).
2024.05.28b Added gaussianSmooth(). Works for arrays or dopey dicts (not result dicts, tho).
2024.05.28  Starting to add some fitting methods.
            methods gaussian() and gaussian2() are returning gaussian curves (1 and 2 peaks).
            method fitGaussian() and fitGaussian2() are fitting functions.
            Neither takes dopey dicts but actual arrays.
2024.05.26  Bugfix in compact() (key Type supposed to be type).
2024.05.17  Modifying methods from the original dopey_methods.py. So far: subArray(), compact(), secondDerivative(),
            and gaussianSmooth(). That was all the methods I had created so far, so done!

============================================
dopey_constants.py
============================================

2024.09.18  Added DATA_AXES and DATA_INTENSITIES (containing [x,y,z] and [intensity, intensity_mean]).
2024.08.30  Added DEFLECTOR_X, DEFLECTOR_Y = DEFLECTORS[0], DEFLECTORS[1].
            Make sure to, with time, remove the use of DEFLECTORX and DEFLECTORY in the modules,
2024.05.16  CCD_ANALYZERS = ["PhoibosCCD", "AnalyzerCCD"], SPIN_ANALYZERS = ["PhoibosSpin"], SHERMAN = 0.29,
            and DEFLECTORS = ['ShiftX [a.u.]', 'ShiftY [a.u.]']

============================================
dopey_spin.py
============================================

2024.11.27  All mergeSpin...() methods are now called insertSpin...(). Works for EDC, MDC, and map (insertSpinEDC(), insertSpinMDC(), and insertSpinMap()). Common method insertSpinMap().
2024.11.02  Bugfig in mergeSpinMDC().
2024.11.01b Renamed mergeSpinEDC() and mergeSpinMDC() to insertSpinEDC() and insertSpinMDC().
2024.11.01  added mergeSpinMDC() and also mergeSpinData() that uses either mergeSpinMDC() or mergeSpinEDC().
            Finished updateSpinMDC(). Added updateSpinData() that calls either updateSpinEDC() or updateSpinMDC().
2024.10.23  inspectSpin() now works for edc and mdc (FAT and FE).
            updateMDC() is stil under construction.
2024.10.18  Updated inspectSpin(). Works for spin_edc and spin_mdc (FE, not FAT yet).
2024.10.17  Adding updateSpinEDC() and inspectSpin().
2024.10.02  Fixed bug in rotatePolarization().
2024.09.17b Added deleteSpinEDCCurve().
2024.09.17  Added mergeSpinEDS(edc1, edc2).
2024.05.29  The folder was renamed to dopey so I had to update the import from dopey_constants.py and dopey_methods.py.
2024.05.26  Fixed a couple of bugs where the old key name Type had not been changed to type.
            Edited despikeSpin() and getSpinEDCfromMDC() so that they work. 
            Edited polarization() so that it works.
            Edited rotatePolarization() so that it should(!) work.
            normalizeSpin() works for edc but there seem to be a bug for mdc. Have not dug into that.
2024.05.24  Copied dopey_sin.py from the first dopey and started to edit it. Done so far: quickSpin().

============================================
dopey_export2txt.py
============================================

2024.05.28  This module is for exporting data to text files (instead of having to deal with the annoying xy format.)
            Ready: arpes, spin_edc, and spin_mdc (for FE).

============================================
dopey_spin.py
============================================

2024.10.07  Kind of finished fermiFit(). Returns a dict. Have to update dopey_plot.plot().
2024.10.06  Started to work on a module for curve fitting.

============================================
dopey_extra_spin_map.py
============================================

2024.11.25  concatSpin() works.
2024.10.25  Started to work on methods for spin maps...

============================================
dopey_dichroism.py
============================================

2024.11.22b Renamed the module dopey_dichroism.py to not be an extra module but part of the basics.
2024.11.22  Updates and bugfixes.
2024.11.21  Methods plotDichroism() and dichroism() ready.
2024.11.13  Methods for dichroism as an extra module (dopey_extra_dichroism.py)

============================================
dopey_help.txt
============================================

2024.10.29  Added align().
2024.06.03  Short description of the main methods. To use in the __ini__.py file.


============================================
Known or suspected bugs, and stuff to do:
============================================

    2024.08.30  refs        all files?          many methods            Remove references to DEFLECTORX and DEFLECTORY, 
                                                                        and use DEFLECTOR_X and DEFLECTOR_Y instead.
    2024.05.26  bug?        dopery_spin.py      normalizeSpin()         Seems like it does not work for mdc.
